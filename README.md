# CSS Animations

My playground to house a collection of various css animation projects I've created.

## Projects

### 1. CSS Text Background using gif

![Image Alt Text](https://github.com/nesalot/css-animations/blob/main/text-bg-gif/jmerrell_text-bg-gif.gif)

#### Things Explored:
* Used an animated gif to overlay over text to give a cool effect.
* Used CSS min/max property. ex: `font-size: min(max(18px, 1.8vw), 24px)` which has 18px min and 24px max font size with 1.8vw scaling.
* Visit my codepen for example: [CSS Text Background Animation using gif](https://codepen.io/nesalot/pen/QWPvjPw)
