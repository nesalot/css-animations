# CSS Animations

My playground to house a collection of various css animation projects I've created.

## Projects

### CSS Text Background using Gif

![Image Alt Text](https://github.com/nesalot/css-animations/blob/main/text-bg-gif/jmerrell_text-bg-gif.gif)

* Learned how to use animated gif to overlay over text to give a cool effect.
* Learned about CSS min/max property ex: `font-size: min(max(18px, 1.8vw), 24px);` which has 18px min and 24px max with 1.8vw scaling.
